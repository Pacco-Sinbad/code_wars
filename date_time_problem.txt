Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.

Examples (Input -> Output)
* [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
* [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
* [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
* [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5
Notes
You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

Examples:(Input --> Output)

121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation))

1, 1 --> "10" (1 + 1 = 2 in decimal or 10 in binary)
5, 9 --> "1110" (5 + 9 = 14 in decimal or 1110 in binary)

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"

In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.
More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to equal or surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

Examples:
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10
Note:
Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.

Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

I am going to be doing multiple codewars today for the homework assignment

1. 8 kyu
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
2. 7 kyu
Remove words from the sentence if they contain exactly one exclamation mark. Words are separated by a single space, without leading/trailing spaces.

Examples
remove("Hi!") === ""
remove("Hi! Hi!") === ""
remove("Hi! Hi! Hi!") === ""
remove("Hi Hi! Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("Hi! !Hi Hi!") === ""
remove("Hi! Hi!! Hi!") === "Hi!!"
remove("Hi! !Hi! Hi!") === "!Hi!"
3.6kyu
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

Dot Calculator
You have to write a calculator that receives strings for input. The dots will represent the number in the equation. There will be dots on one side, an operator, and dots again after the operator. The dots and the operator will be separated by one space.

Here are the following valid operators :

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
// Integer Division
Your Work (Task)
You'll have to return a string that contains dots, as many the equation returns. If the result is 0, return the empty string. When it comes to subtraction, the first number will always be greater than or equal to the second number.

Examples (Input => Output)
* "..... + ..............." => "...................."
* "..... - ..."             => ".."
* "..... - ."               => "...."
* "..... * ..."             => "..............."
* "..... * .."              => ".........."
* "..... // .."             => ".."
* "..... // ."              => "....."

All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1. (81-1-1-81)

Example #2: An input of 765 will/should return 493625 because 72 is 49, 62 is 36, and 52 is 25. (49-36-25)

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

Happy Coding!

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("

Story
Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

Examples (Input --> Output)
[1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
[2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
[1]         --> [1,1]
Remarks
All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Vampire Numbers
Our loose definition of Vampire Numbers can be described as follows:

6 * 21 = 126
# 6 and 21 would be valid 'fangs' for a vampire number as the 
# digits 6, 1, and 2 are present in both the product and multiplicands

10 * 11 = 110
# 110 is not a vampire number since there are three 1's in the
# multiplicands, but only two 1's in the product

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.

Usage Examples:
cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

Count the number of Duplicates
Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.

Example
"abcde" -> 0 # no characters repeats more than once
"aabbcde" -> 2 # 'a' and 'b'
"aabBcde" -> 2 # 'a' occurs twice and 'b' twice (`b` and `B`)
"indivisibility" -> 1 # 'i' occurs six times
"Indivisibilities" -> 2 # 'i' occurs seven times and 's' occurs twice
"aA11" -> 2 # 'a' and '1'
"ABBA" -> 2 # 'A' and 'B' each occur twice

/////

Take 2 strings s1 and s2 including only letters from a to z. Return a new sorted string, the longest possible, containing distinct letters - each taken only once - coming from s1 or s2.

Examples:
a = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
b = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"
longest(a, b) -> "abcdefklmopqwxy"

a = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
longest(a, a) -> "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"


/////

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"

Ahoy matey!

You are a leader of a small pirate crew. And you have a plan. With the help of OOP you wish to make a pretty efficient system to identify ships with heavy booty on board!

Unfortunately for you, people weigh a lot these days, so how do you know if a ship is full of gold and not people?

You begin with writing a generic Ship class / struct:

function Ship(draft,crew) {
 this.draft = draft;
 this.crew = crew;
}
Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object based on their observations:

draft - an estimate of the ship's weight based on how low it is in the water
crew - the count of crew on board
var titanic = new Ship(15, 10);
Task
You have access to the ship "draft" and "crew". "Draft" is the total ship weight and "crew" is the number of humans on the ship.

Each crew member adds 1.5 units to the ship draft. If after removing the weight of the crew, the draft is still more than 20, then the ship is worth looting. Any ship weighing that much must have a lot of booty!

Add the method

isWorthIt
to decide if the ship is worthy to loot. For example:

titanic.isWorthIt() // return false
Good luck and may you find GOOOLD!

Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win.

The Task
Think of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object). The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.
The Database
english: 'Welcome',
czech: 'Vitejte',
danish: 'Velkomst',
dutch: 'Welkom',
estonian: 'Tere tulemast',
finnish: 'Tervetuloa',
flemish: 'Welgekomen',

italian: 'Benvenuto',
latvian: 'Gaidits',
lithuanian: 'Laukiamas',

Possible invalid inputs include:

IP_ADDRESS_INVALID - not a valid ipv4 or ipv6 ip address
IP_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND - ip address not in the database
IP_ADDRESS_REQUIRED - no ip address was supplied
